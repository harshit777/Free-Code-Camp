# Free Code Camp Algorithm Solutions

#### Hi guys, here are some of the solutions to FCC Algorithms in Go & Javascript.

In future, I would like to add python solutions too.

The emphasis for solving the algorithms was on using Golang and then javascript.
You will find better explanation to solutions in the Golang code.

If at any point you find a bug or have a better solution, please let me know, I would be happy to refactor the code :)

These solutions are part of my learning journey into code.

If you have any suggestions do let me know.
